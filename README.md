## **⤵️ For those who want to know more**

### **1) 🔎 Repo Organization**

* Please, refer to the badges "`development`" you can find in each `README`, below you can find some additional infos.
* **As a general rule**, take in mind that my entire [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Mrcuve0) (themes included!) is based on my sparse time and it is mainly passion-driven, so expect high delays when dealing with issues or enhancements.

  1. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Ongoing-brightgreen.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Ongoing-brightgreen.svg)
     > This means I'm currently enhancing/fixing the project. I'm open to suggestions and Pull Requests, that will be treated as soon as possible.
  1. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Paused-yellow.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Paused-yellow.svg)
     > This means I'm currently not considering the project as a top priority, hence issues and Pull Request will be still treated, but with higher delays. The development status can reach a higher priority ("Ongoing") or a lower one "Stopped" at any time.
  1. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red.svg)
     > This means I'd prefer to consider this project abandoned. I could reconsider this development status only if some really big opportunities present themselves and really worth the effort. Issues and PR will be probably read but not considered.

### **2) 💙 DONATIONS**

> I hope that this theme is to your liking and I hope that, as it was in my case, this can become your everyday theme.
>
> I am sure you will appreciate all the work behind this repo and the many hours of my free time that I have dedicated (and will continue to devote) to this project.
> 
> If you want, you can consider a small donation to support future developments for this and many new projects that will come in the future.
>
> Thank you for your time.

      * [![alt text](https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://paypal.me/mrcuve0)

### **3) 📎 LICENSES**
Many of my projects rely on other's people previous work, each of them with their proper license.
I always try to be as correct and thankful as possible: if you see some inconsistencies on licenses please be free to open an issue/PR for this repo and explain the problem. I will reply ASAP and fix the issue. The last thing I want to do is to harm someone else's IP. 

Of course, I'm expecting the same treatment in case you'll decide to publish modifications of my projects.
